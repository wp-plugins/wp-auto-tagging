Description:
============

WP Auto Tagging is a free Wordpress plugin to automatically add tags for Wordpress Posts and Pages. Please note that Plugin is under construction and it is its first release. I will keep it updating with passage of time, you should keep in touch for bugs and problems you find in plugin. WP Auto Tagging works best for big blog owners with more than 300 posts and pages because of its auto tagging functionality.

Why I Needed WP Auto Tagging Wordpress Plugin?
==============================================

I needed WP Auto Tagging Wordpress Plugin for my HD Wallpapers website with more than 9,000 posts. All of the posts were missing tags and I was missing search traffic. I wanted to add 3-4 tags to all the published posts but it was taking lots of my time. I wanted to write a script which could automatically add 4 wordpress tags for all the published posts.
